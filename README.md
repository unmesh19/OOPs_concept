# OOP Concepts in Python

This repository contains examples of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Python. The focus is on demonstrating the following core principles:

1. **Classes and Objects**
2. **Encapsulation**
3. **Inheritance**
4. **Polymorphism**
5. **Abstraction**

Each concept is explored in a separate file, showcasing how they can be applied in real-world scenarios through an `Animal` class hierarchy.

## Classes and Objects

In the `Classes and Objects` file, the foundational concept of classes and objects is introduced. A basic `Animal` class is defined with attributes such as species, sound, age, and colour. Instances of the class are created to illustrate how to use classes to model real-world entities.

## Encapsulation

The `Encapsulation` file demonstrates the concept of encapsulation by using private attributes and getter/setter methods to control access to an object's data. This ensures that the internal state of the object cannot be modified directly from outside the class.

## Inheritance

In the `Inheritance` file, the `Animal` class is extended to create specialized classes such as `WildAnimal`, `Bird`, and `Fish`. This shows how inheritance allows for the creation of subclasses that inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class, promoting code reuse.

## Polymorphism

The `Polymorphism` file illustrates how different classes can implement the same method name but with different behaviors. This is demonstrated through method overriding, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods defined in their parent class.

## Abstraction

The `Abstraction` file (to be added) will encapsulate complex logic in abstract classes and interfaces, allowing users to work with simplified representations of the objects without exposing all the details.

## Usage

To run the examples, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the files. You can then run the individual files using Python:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the appropriate file name to see the output of that OOP concept.
